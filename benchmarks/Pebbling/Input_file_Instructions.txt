1) name of input file: "graph_descr.txt"
2) all nodes are introduced as follows:
name of the node, consisting of string without spaces, + single space + ":" + single space + clauses, associated
to the node. 
3) for any literal, variables, "=" or "!=" and values are separated by single space. Literals in a
clause are separated by single space.  
4) source nodes are called  "source_node_n", where type(n) == int 
5) target nodes are called "target_node_n", where type(n) == int
6) nodes, which are not either target or source, are called node_n, where type(n) == int
7) edges are introduced as follows :
    parent(x) : y
By condition of the exercise there are always either 0 or 2 parents for each node, and either 1 or
0 children for each node. So y is a node with outdegree = 1, and x is a node with indegree 2.  
8) Each line in graph_descr.txt is either introduction of a new node, or introduction of an edge. 
9) The order of introduction are the following : all source nodes, all nodes, all target nodes, all
edges. 
8) Take a look at an exapmle file "graph_descr.txt"
