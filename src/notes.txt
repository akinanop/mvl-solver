Problem is with analyzeConflict()

Note: The algorithm implemented by Lal [15] is essentially the same as Algorithm 7
but the L 0 .reason when L 0 is falsified because of a decision literal L was not set properly to
 ̄ Consequenstly, Lal’s version of the analyzeConflict() function fails
be the clause {L, L}.
to return a learned clause on problems such as that in Example 2 above. Due to this reason,
Lal’s solver crashes on certain inputs.
