Conduct preliminary expriments:

1) Test the solver on randomly generated benchmarks.

1a) Test for Phase transition and compare to the original results: http://www.d.umn.edu/~lalx0004/research/ReducedResults.htm

Domain: 2-10 (step 1)
Variables: 100-1000 (step 100)
Ratio: 1-10 (step 1)

1b) Test unsatisfiable benchmarks described in Jain 2008 (Chapter 6): GT_N, Pigeonhole and Pebbling problems.

2) Compare MVL-Solver with MiniSAT

2a) Compare performance of differenet encodings (linear and quadratic).
2b) Note number of backtracks and decisions, as well as time.
2c) Convert boolean to finite domain (pigeonhole and random) and compare the performance.
